Certainly! Let's create a pamphlet that covers Python loops, along with examples and exercises. We'll include information about data types, input, conditions, data casting, and if-else statements. Here's a concise guide:

# Python Loops: A Comprehensive Guide

## 1. **For Loops**
- A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
- Syntax:
  ```python
  for item in sequence:
      # Code to execute for each item
  ```

### Example: Print Fruits
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

## 2. **While Loops**
- A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
- Syntax:
  ```python
  while condition:
      # Code to execute while condition is true
  ```

### Example: Print Even Numbers
```python
n = 1
while n <= 10:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print(n)
    n += 1
```

## 3. **Range Function**
- The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers.
- Syntax:
  ```python
  for i in range(start, stop, step):
      # Code to execute for each value of i
  ```

### Example: Print Numbers from 1 to 5
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

## 4. **Break and Continue Statements**
- `break`: Exits the loop prematurely.
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next.
- Example:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, 11):
      if i == 5:
          break
      print(i)
  ```

## 5. **Nested Loops**
- You can have loops inside loops (nested loops).
- Example:
  ```python
  for x in range(1, 4):
      for y in range(1, 4):
          print(x, y)
  ```

## 6. **Loop Exercises**
Here are some exercises to practice:

### Exercise 1: Print First 10 Natural Numbers
```python
n = 1
while n <= 10:
    print(n, end=" ")
    n += 1
```

### Exercise 2: Calculate the Sum of Numbers
```python
total = 0
for num in range(1, 11):
    total += num
print("Sum:", total)
```

### Exercise 3: Print a Triangle of Stars
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("*" * i)
```
